== Introduction: What is TDD?

[quote, Wikipedia, Test Driven Development]
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.

[.step]
* But what does that mean in practise?

* Consider tests part of your deliverable. Value test code on par with feature code.

== TDD Methodology

Robert Martin describes the following three rules for TDD.
[.step]
. You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
. You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
. You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.
[.step]
* Also called the Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle.
* Test suites must be fast and run often.

== Test First or Test Later?

In practice, it doesn't matter if the test is written first or later. The important part is the short feedback loop.

Running the tests frequently and close to when you make changes, helps you identify bugs/mistakes sooner.

== Why bother?

[.step]
* Helps you "discover" solutions
* Fewer bug fixing cycles
* Long term confidence in code
* Provides a "safety net" for future changes
* Leads to functional/E2E tests
* Easily accessible documentation
* Strategic goal for 2017!


== String Calculator Kata

. Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)

 ** The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”

. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).

== Legacy Change Algorithm

. Identify change points
. Find test points
. Break dependencies
. Write tests
. Make changes and refactor

== Strategy for Analyzing Existing Code

Effect Propagation Method

. Identify a method that will change
. Examine return values and where they are used
. Examine changes in class fields
    ** Investigate super- and subclasses
. Examine side effects on method parameters
    ** Investigate where method parameters may be accessed by callers
. Examine modifications in static/global data

== More than finding bugs!

Tests aren't just to find bugs. Tests also document how code behaves. When working in a legacy environment without test cases, an effective method
for analyzing code is to write characterization tests. This type of test is meant to find out what the existing code does, so that you can use or modify it.

Over time, this increases overall test coverage, helps you understand what the method you're calling does, and communicate that behavior to later developers.
Writing these type of tests increases your confidence that the existing methods you're using work the way you expect. Combined with using TDD practices
while writing the new features, this reduces the risks associated with a change.

== Method Use Rule

[quote, Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code]
."Method Use" Rule
Before you use a method, check to see if there are tests. If there aren't, write them.

== How to write Characterization Tests

. Write a test that uses the legacy code
. Write an assertion that you know will fail
. Learn from the failure how the code actually behaves
. Change the assertion to match the existing behavior

== Characterization Test Demo

== What to do when you can't Test

You have to add functionality, but there are no tests and you don't have time or the existing code is hard to test.

* Sprout Method/Class
* Wrapper Method/Class

== Sprout Method
[.step]
[source,java]
.Existing Code
public void pay() {
    // Do stuff related to payment
}

[%step]
--
[source,java]
.Add it inline? No way!
public void pay() {
    // Add auditing logic here
    // Do stuff related to payment
}

--
[%step]
--
[source,java]
.Sprout a method or Class
public void pay() {
    writeAuditTrail();
    // Do stuff related to payment
}

--
[%step]

== Wrap example
[.step]
[source,java]
.Wrap Legacy method
public void pay() {
    doLegacyPayment();
}

[.step]
--
[source,java]
.Add new features in the wrapper method
public void pay() {
    writeAuditTrail();
    doLegacyPayment();
}

--
[.step]
--
[source,java]
.Or wrap existing method in some cases
public void payWithAuditing() {
    writeAuditTrail();
    pay();
}

--
[.step]

== Cost of Testing

Scenario:

* You spend two hours writing tests for a change you're about to make in an existing system.
* You spend fifteen minutes making the actual change.
* Was that two hours wasted?

== Summary

* What, how, and why of TDD
* TDD and Legacy code
* Making the best of a bad situation

== Challenge

What is in the way of you (as a team or individual) putting TDD into practice?
